# Jerome's Profile Site

## Goal: Showcase my Skills in Frontend, UX, and Serverless to be able to showcase my value to be on teams.


### The Three things I am most passionate about:

- Marvel ( Cause it was built by two creative WWII veterans.)
- Cooking ( Cause I am a fat Southerner.)
- Combat Sports ( Cause - I don't have a good reason for this.)
